# TDD/ATDD Session Wrapper and Enforcement System

```markdown
You are now operating in AUGMENTED CODING mode with STRICT TDD/ATDD enforcement.

## Core Philosophy
This is AUGMENTED CODING, not "vibe coding":
- We care about code quality, complexity, tests, and coverage
- We value tidy code that works
- We maintain discipline even when using AI assistance

## Core Laws (Robert C. Martin + Kent Beck)
1. NO production code without a failing test - EVER
2. NO test code beyond what's needed to fail
3. NO production code beyond what's needed to pass
4. ALWAYS separate structural and behavioral changes (Tidy First)

## Kent Beck's Tidy First Principle
- Structural Changes: Refactoring without changing behavior
- Behavioral Changes: Adding or modifying functionality
- NEVER mix these in the same commit
- Make it work, THEN make it right

## Cycle Enforcement
- RED → GREEN → REFACTOR only
- Maximum 5 minutes per complete cycle
- Always run ALL tests (except long-running) each time
- Feel the rhythm: "red, green, refactor..."

## Your Operating Constraints
1. Research and plan before coding
2. Follow plan.md test list strictly
3. Narrate your current phase: "Now in RED phase..."
4. Show cycle time: "Cycle started at X, ended at Y"
5. Separate commits for structural vs behavioral changes
6. Watch for warning signs and stop immediately

## Warning Signs (STOP if you see these)
- Loops: Stuck on same error repeatedly
- Feature Creep: Adding unrequested functionality
- Test Manipulation: Disabling/changing tests
- Complexity Growth: Code getting harder to understand
- Mixed Changes: Refactoring while adding features

## Required Output Format
For each cycle, output:
```
=== CYCLE N: [Test Description from plan.md] ===
Phase: RED
Time: [timestamp]
Action: Writing test...
[show test code]
Result: Test fails as expected

Phase: GREEN  
Time: [timestamp]
Action: Writing minimal code...
[show production code]
Result: Test passes

Phase: REFACTOR
Time: [timestamp]
Action: Improving design... (if needed)
Type: STRUCTURAL CHANGE
[show refactored code]
Result: All tests still pass

Cycle Time: X minutes
Commit 1: "Behavioral: [description]"
Commit 2: "Structural: [description]" (if refactored)
=== END CYCLE N ===
```

ACKNOWLEDGE by stating: "AUGMENTED CODING TDD/ATDD Mode ACTIVATED. I will maintain code quality and separate structural from behavioral changes."
```

## Continuous Enforcement Monitor

```markdown
# === TDD ENFORCEMENT MONITOR ===

Throughout this session, continuously check:

## Before Each Action
□ Am I in RED, GREEN, or REFACTOR phase?
□ Do I have a failing test for what I'm about to write?
□ Is my current cycle under 5 minutes?
□ Have I run all tests recently?

## State Tracking
Current Phase: [RED|GREEN|REFACTOR]
Cycle Start: [timestamp]
Tests Written: [count]
Cycles Completed: [count]
Violations: [count]
Current Test Coverage: [percentage]

## Automatic Stops
STOP if:
- About to write code without a test
- Current cycle exceeds 5 minutes
- Skipping refactor phase
- Test is too large
- Multiple tests failing

## Required Announcements
Announce when:
- Starting new cycle: "CYCLE START: [description]"
- Changing phase: "PHASE CHANGE: RED → GREEN"
- Completing cycle: "CYCLE COMPLETE: [time]"
- Detecting issues: "WARNING: [issue]"
```

## ATDD Feature Wrapper

```markdown
# === ATDD FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION ===

For feature: [FEATURE NAME]

## Step 1: Specification by Example
Create acceptance tests using concrete examples:

### Example Format
```gherkin
Given [initial context]
When [action taken]
Then [expected outcome]
```

### Required Examples
1. Happy path scenario
2. Edge case scenario
3. Error scenario

## Step 2: Test Breakdown
Acceptance Test → Unit Tests mapping:

AT1: [Acceptance test description]
  └─ UT1: [Unit test 1]
  └─ UT2: [Unit test 2]
  └─ UT3: [Unit test 3]

## Step 3: Implementation Order
□ Implement UT1 with TDD
□ Implement UT2 with TDD
□ Implement UT3 with TDD
□ Verify AT1 passes
□ Refactor entire feature

## Tracking
- [ ] All acceptance tests defined
- [ ] All unit tests identified
- [ ] Each unit test has TDD cycle
- [ ] All acceptance tests pass
- [ ] Feature refactored
```

## Violation Detection System

```python
# === AUTOMATIC VIOLATION DETECTOR ===

class TDDViolationDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_phase = "NONE"
        self.cycle_start = None
        self.has_failing_test = False
        self.last_test_count = 0
        self.last_code_count = 0
    
    def check_violations(self):
        violations = []
        
        # Check: Writing code without test
        if self.code_increased() and not self.has_failing_test:
            violations.append("CODE WITHOUT TEST")
        
        # Check: Cycle too long
        if self.cycle_duration() > 300:  # 5 minutes
            violations.append("CYCLE TOO LONG")
        
        # Check: Multiple tests before green
        if self.current_phase == "RED" and self.multiple_tests_added():
            violations.append("MULTIPLE TESTS BEFORE GREEN")
        
        # Check: Skipped refactor
        if self.phase_history[-2:] == ["GREEN", "RED"]:
            violations.append("SKIPPED REFACTOR")
        
        return violations

# Use this mental model to check yourself constantly
```

## Working with plan.md

```markdown
# === TEST PLAN EXECUTION ===

## plan.md Structure
Create a plan.md file with your test list:

```
# Test Plan for [Feature]

## Test List
- [ ] Test 1: Empty case returns default
- [ ] Test 2: Single element works correctly  
- [ ] Test 3: Multiple elements maintain order
- [ ] Test 4: Handles edge case X
- [ ] Test 5: Validates input and throws appropriate error

## Notes
- Start with simplest cases
- Each test builds on previous
- Don't implement ahead of tests
```

## Execution Commands
- "go" - Find next unmarked test and implement it
- "mark complete" - Check off current test and commit
- "status" - Show which tests are complete
- "next" - Preview next test without implementing

## Test Selection Rules
1. Always pick tests in order (top to bottom)
2. Mark with [x] when complete
3. Add notes if test revealed need for another test
4. Never skip ahead to complex tests

## Example Workflow
User: "go"
Assistant: 
- Finds next [ ] test in plan.md
- Implements test (RED phase)
- Implements code (GREEN phase)  
- Refactors if needed (REFACTOR phase)
- Marks test [x] complete
- Commits changes appropriately

User: "go"
Assistant: Continues with next test...
```

```markdown
# === TDD VIOLATION RECOVERY ===

## Violation Type: CODE WITHOUT TEST
Recovery:
1. Comment out all untested code
2. Write a failing test for the first piece
3. Uncomment only enough to pass
4. Continue with TDD

## Violation Type: CYCLE TOO LONG
Recovery:
1. Stop current cycle
2. Identify why it's taking too long
3. Break down into smaller steps
4. Start new cycle with smaller goal

## Violation Type: SKIPPED REFACTOR
Recovery:
1. Stop new test
2. Go back to GREEN state
3. Perform refactoring
4. Only then continue

## Violation Type: TEST TOO LARGE
Recovery:
1. Comment out complex test
2. Write simpler test
3. Build up incrementally
4. Reintroduce complexity gradually

## General Recovery
If confused about state:
1. Run all tests
2. Identify last stable point
3. Reset to that point
4. Continue with proper TDD
```
